    <h2 class="mt0-ns lh-title">The LendUp Ladder</h2>
    <p class="measure mt0">The LendUp Ladder is a path from payday loans to better financial health. This core product of the LendUp loans business was a finalist in the <i>Fast Company</i> &#8220;Innovation By Design&#8221; Awards in 2017.</p>
    <p class="measure">Many people borrow payday loans because they are denied better credit products from traditional lenders. We believed these folks could be quite creditworthy despite lacking a good credit score. By rewarding on-time loan repayment and other positive behaviors with the ability to borrow on better terms and build credit, we were able to provide options that customers couldn&#8217;t access anywhere else.</p>
    <p class="measure">As employee #8 at LendUp, I led this product from the beginning, including its name, game design, product design, and frontend engineering. Over the years I supported iterations of the Ladder as a product manager, designer, and consultant for newer PMs.</p>

    <h2 class="mt0-ns lh-title">Loans customer dashboard</h2>
    <p class="measure mt0">One of my first projects at LendUp was the customer dashboard. In those days of MVPs, I designed and built it quickly, and it ended up working just fine for years. Much later, the new product team wanted to update its visual design to adhere to the new visual design language. It seemed an appropriate occasion to talk to some LendUp customers about how the product is working (or not) for them.</p>
    <p class="measure">We brought in six customers and talked about their lives, how LendUp fits in, and in particular, how they use their dashboard. We were pleased to learn there were no big problems we&#8217;d overlooked, which gave us the confidence to proceed with a visual redesign, leaving the basic structure and mechanics intact. I played a purely lead role in this project, directing the team toward the desired outcome.</p>

    <img src="/images/IVR.jpg" alt="A photo of printed specifications for the IVR system" />

  <div class="fn fl-ns w-50-ns">
    <h2 class="mt0-ns lh-title">Interactive voice response</h2>
    <p class="measure mt0">Despite an awesome website, some LendUp customers preferred to contact the company by phone. Often, they sought basic information, like the amount and date of their next loan payment. This wasn&#8217;t a good use of customer service agents&#8217; time, so we built an IVR system to address such questions.</p>
    <p class="measure">I led this effort from product management to design. I defined the authentication experience, considered all user contexts, wrote the scripts and defined the variables, even dividing the scripts into reusable sentence fragments to optimize recording time. I also coordinated and oversaw the recording session, in a call booth, at LendUp HQ. It was fun.</p>

    <img src="/images/tesseract-hubble-2.jpg" alt="Screenshots of internal tools" />
    <p class="f6 gray i">I defined the product, UX, and an MVP visual design of Tesseract (front). At left, some recent visual design ideas for Hubble from my teammate Chau Nguyen.</p>

  <div class="fn fl-ns w-50-ns">
    <h2 class="mt0-ns lh-title">Tesseract & Hubble</h2>
    <p class="measure mt0">I enjoy building internal tools. I like helping my team do their best work, and nice internal tools say a lot about a company&#8217;s culture. Also, when your customers are sitting a few feet away from you, it&#8217;s easy and satisfying to nail product-market fit and deliver great design.</p>
    <p class="measure">Tesseract lets the compliance team examine any detail about any loan we&#8217;ve ever issued. Given that breadth of requirements, it&#8217;s a kind of web interface for SQL selects, optimized for their workflow. </p>
    <p class="measure">Hubble is what the customer insights team uses to view and update account information while talking to the customer on the phone (among many other things). I designed and built much of the first version of this product several years ago, which is still being used today, hundreds of thousands of customers later.</p>

    <h2 class="mt0-ns lh-title">Ladders not chutes tee</h2>
    <p class="measure mt0">This year, the People Operations team asked for a t-shirt design based on the core company value &#8220;Ladders not chutes&#8221;. My visual designer teammates usually designed the company swag, but this time I decided to take a crack at it. </p>
    <p class="measure">I wanted to do something hand-drawn, because I enjoy making things by hand. To entice folks to wear these outside of the gym, I intentionally developed a treatment a bit subtler than &#8220;here&#8217;s the startup I work for&#8221;. I painted the original artwork in black, transferred it and applied the color gradient, and oversaw the production.</p>

    <p class="measure mt0-ns">CHARMED is a standard of quality. <a href="CHARMED.html">It's available here on Github, take it, use it</a>.</p>
    <p class="measure">This is my evolution of a quality standard called CARMEL that I championed at LendUp. It came about because, while the design team followed many best practices, we weren&#8217;t achieving a user experience of consistently high quality. To solve this, I defined a standard of design quality that is as objective as possible.</p>
