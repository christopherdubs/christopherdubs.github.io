<p class="mt0">Here are some selections of my product design work from six years in various roles at LendUp. <!-- For more about my career in design, product management, and engineering, see <a href="resume.html">my resume</a>. --></p>

      <h2 class="lh-title">CHARMED</h2>
      <p>CHARMED is a standard of quality: Coherent, Human, Accessible, Recoverable, Mindful, and Efficient Design. It comes with a process that brings it to life. Details and methodologies are all available on Github. I <a href="/projects/2018-Q4-recent-work.html">followed the process</a> to create this very page.</p>
      <p>This is my evolution of a quality standard called CARMEL that I championed at LendUp. It came about because, while the design team followed many best practices, we weren&#8217;t achieving a user experience of consistently high quality. To solve this, I defined a standard of design quality that is as objective as possible, and we optimized our design process to reliably meet this standard. My teammates Ryan Varick and Katherine Cleghorn contributed significantly on process and content standards, respectively.</p>

      <h2 class="lh-title">The LendUp Ladder</h2>
      <p>The LendUp Ladder is a path from payday loans to better financial health. This core product of the LendUp loans business was a finalist in Fast Company&#8217;s Innovation By Design awards in 2017.</p>
      <p>Many people borrow payday loans because they are denied better credit products from traditional lenders. We believed these folks could be quite creditworthy despite lacking a good credit score. By rewarding on-time loan repayment and other positive behaviors with the ability to borrow on better terms and build credit, we were able to provide options that customers couldn&#8217;t access anywhere else.</p>
      <p>As employee #8 at LendUp, I led this product from the beginning, including its name, game design, product design, and frontend engineering. Over the years I supported iterations of the Ladder as a product manager, designer, and consultant for newer PMs. The image above is recent visual design by my teammate Chau Nguyen and a contractor&#8217;s illustration.</p>

    <h2 class="lh-title">Loans customer dashboard research</h2>
    <p>One of my first projects at LendUp was the customer dashboard. In those days of MVPs, I designed and built it quickly, and it ended up working just fine for years. Much later, the new product team wanted to update its visual design to adhere to the new visual design language. It seemed an appropriate occasion to talk to some LendUp customers about how the product is working (or not) for them.</p>
    <p>We brought in six customers and talked about their lives, how LendUp fits in, and in particular, how they use their dashboard. We were pleased to learn there were no big problems we&#8217;d overlooked, which gave us the confidence to proceed with a visual redesign, leaving the basic structure and mechanics intact. I played a purely lead role in this project, directing the team toward the desired outcome. My teammate Chau Nguyen executed the research session and developed the visual designs shown above.

    <h2 class="lh-title">Interactive voice response</h2>
    <p>Despite an awesome website, some LendUp customers preferred to contact us by phone. Often, they sought basic information, like the amount and date of their next loan payment. This wasn&#8217;t a good use of customer service agents&#8217; time, so we built an IVR system to address such questions.</p>
    <p>I led this effort from product management to design. I defined the authentication experience, considered all user contexts, wrote the scripts and defined the variables, even dividing the scripts into reusable sentence fragments to optimize recording time. I also coordinated and oversaw the recording session, in a call booth, at LendUp HQ. It was fun.</p>

    <h2 class="lh-title">Tesseract & Hubble</h2>
    <p>I enjoy building internal tools. I like helping my team do their best work, and nice internal tools say a lot about a company&#8217;s culture. Also, when your customers are sitting a few feet away from you, it&#8217;s easy and satisfying to nail product-market fit and deliver great design.</p>
    <p>Tesseract lets the compliance team examine any detail about any loan we&#8217;ve ever issued. Given that breadth of requirements, it&#8217;s a kind of web interface for SQL selects, optimized for their workflow. I defined the product and visual design (left).</p>
    <p>Hubble is what the customer insights team uses view and update account information while talking to the customer on the phone (among many other things). I designed and built much of the first version of this product several years ago, which is still being used today, hundreds of thousands of customers later. The updated visual design (right) was developed by my teammate Chau Nguyen.</p>

    <h2 class="lh-title">Ladders not chutes tee</h2>
    <p>This year, the People Operations team asked for a t-shirt design based on the core company value &#8220;Ladders not chutes&#8221;. My visual designer teammates usually designed the company swag, but this time I decided to take a crack at it. </p>
    <p>I wanted to do something hand-drawn, because I enjoy making things by hand. To entice folks to wear these outside of the gym, I intentionally developed a treatment a bit subtler than &#8220;here&#8217;s the startup I work for&#8221;. I painted the original artwork in black, transferred it and applied the color gradient, and oversaw the production.</p>
