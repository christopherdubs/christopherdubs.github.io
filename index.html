    <p class="mt0 gray">🏆 Fast Company &#8220;Innovation By Design&#8221; Finalist, 2017</p>
    <p class="measure">The LendUp Ladder is the path from payday loans to better financial health, and the core product of the LendUp loans business. I led this product from the beginning, including its name, game design, product design, and frontend engineering. Over the years I contributed to its evolution as a product lead, design lead, and consultant for newer PMs.</p>
    <p class="measure">Many people borrow payday loans because they are denied better credit products from traditional lenders. We believed these folks could be quite creditworthy despite lacking a good credit score. By rewarding on-time loan repayment and other positive behaviors with the ability to borrow on better terms and build credit, we were able to provide options that customers couldn&#8217;t access anywhere else.</p>

    <p class="mt0 gray">Loans customers and their dashboard</p>
    <p class="measure">One of my first projects at LendUp was the customer dashboard. We needed to ship it yesterday, so I designed and built it quickly, completely on a hunch. It ended up working just fine for years. Much later, the new product team wanted to update its visual design to adhere to the new visual design language. It seemed an appropriate occasion to talk to some LendUp customers about how the product is working (or not) for them.</p>
    <p class="measure">We brought in six customers and talked about their lives, how LendUp fits in, and in particular, how they use their dashboard. We were pleased to learn there were no big problems we&#8217;d overlooked, which gave us the confidence to proceed with a visual redesign, leaving the basic structure and mechanics intact. I played a purely lead role in this project, directing the team toward the desired outcome.</p>

    <img src="/images/IVR.jpg" alt="A photo of printed specifications for the IVR system" />
    <p class="f6 gray i">As design lead, much of my time was spent writing: building and documenting the concepts behind the visual, and in this case auditory, experience.</p>

    <h2 class="mt0-ns mb1 lh-title">UX for your ears</h2>
    <p class="mt0 gray">An interactive voice response system</p>
    <p class="measure">Despite an awesome website, some LendUp customers preferred to contact the company by phone. Often, they sought basic information, like the amount and date of their next loan payment. This wasn&#8217;t a good use of customer service agents&#8217; time, so we built an IVR system to address such questions.</p>
    <p class="measure">I led this effort from product management to design. I defined the authentication experience, considered all user contexts, wrote the scripts and defined the variables, even dividing the scripts into reusable sentence fragments to optimize recording time. I also coordinated and oversaw the recording session, in a call booth, at LendUp HQ. It was fun.</p>

    <p class="f6 gray i">I defined the product, UX, and an MVP visual design of Tesseract (front, and background). At left, some recent visual design ideas for Hubble from my team.</p>

    <h2 class="mt0-ns mb1 lh-title">Internal power</h2>
    <p class="mt0 gray">Compliance and customer insights with Tesseract and Hubble</h2>
    <p class="measure mt0">I enjoy helping my team do their best work, and quality internal tools say a lot about a company&#8217;s culture. Also, when your customers are sitting a few feet away from you, it&#8217;s easy and satisfying to nail product-market fit and deliver great design.</p>
    <p class="measure">Tesseract lets the compliance team examine any detail about any loan we&#8217;ve ever issued. Given that breadth of requirements, it&#8217;s a kind of web interface for SQL selects, optimized for their workflow. </p>
    <p class="measure">Hubble is what the customer insights team uses to view and update account information while talking to the customer on the phone (among many other things). I designed and built much of the first version of this product several years ago, which is still being used today, hundreds of thousands of customers later.</p>

    <p class="mt0 gray">The Ladders Not Chutes Tee</p>
    <p class="measure">This year, the People Operations team asked for a t-shirt design based on the core company value &#8220;Ladders not chutes&#8221;. My visual designer teammates usually designed the company swag, but this time I decided to take a crack at it. </p>
    <p class="measure">I wanted to do something hand-drawn, because I enjoy making things by hand. To entice folks to wear these outside of the gym, I intentionally developed a treatment a bit subtler than &#8220;here&#8217;s the startup I work for&#8221;. I painted the original artwork in black, transferred it and applied the color gradient, and oversaw the production.</p>

    <p class="measure mt0-ns">CHARMED is a standard of quality. <a href="CHARMED.html">It&#8217;s available here on Github, take it, use it</a>.</p>
    <p class="measure">This is my evolution of a quality standard called CARMEL that I championed at LendUp. It came about because, while the design team followed many best practices, we weren&#8217;t achieving a user experience of consistently high quality. To solve this, I defined a standard of design quality that is as objective as possible.</p>
