    <p class="mt0 mb4-ns silver">üèÜ Fast Company &#8220;Innovation By Design&#8221; Finalist, 2017</p>
    <p class="measure">The LendUp Ladder is the path from payday loans to better financial health, and the core product of the LendUp loans business. I led this product from the beginning, including its name, game design, product design, and frontend engineering. Over the years I contributed to its evolution as a product lead, design lead, and consultant for newer PMs.</p>
    <p class="measure">Many people borrow payday loans because they are denied better credit products from traditional lenders. We believed these folks could be quite creditworthy despite lacking a good credit score. By rewarding on-time loan repayment and other positive behaviors with the ability to borrow on better terms and build credit, we were able to provide options that customers couldn&#8217;t access anywhere else.</p>

    <p class="mt0 mb4-ns silver">Loans customers and their dashboard</p>
    <p class="measure">One of my first projects at LendUp was the customer dashboard. We needed to ship it yesterday, so I designed and built it quickly, completely on a hunch. It ended up working just fine for years. Much later, the new product team wanted to update its visual design to adhere to the new visual design language. It seemed an appropriate occasion to talk to some LendUp customers about how the product is working (or not) for them.</p>
    <p class="measure">We brought in six customers and talked about their lives, how LendUp fits in, and in particular, how they use their dashboard. We were pleased to learn there were no big problems we&#8217;d overlooked, which gave us the confidence to proceed with a visual redesign, leaving the basic structure and mechanics intact. I played a purely lead role in this project, directing the team toward the desired outcome.</p>

    <img src="/images/IVR.jpg" alt="A photo of printed specifications for the IVR system" />
    <p class="f6 silver i mt1">As design lead, much of my time was spent writing: building and documenting the concepts behind the visual, and in this case auditory, experience.</p>

    <h2 class="mb1 black f2-ns">UX for your ears</h2>
    <p class="mt0 mb4-ns silver">An interactive voice response system</p>
    <p class="measure">Despite an awesome website, some LendUp customers preferred to contact the company by phone. Often, they sought basic information, like the amount and date of their next loan payment. This wasn&#8217;t a good use of customer service agents&#8217; time, so we built an IVR system to address such questions.</p>
    <p class="measure">I led this project from product management to design, defining authentication, considering user contexts, writing the scripts and defining variables, even dividing the scripts into reusable fragments for recording. I also put together the recording session, in a call booth at LendUp HQ.</p>

    <img src="/images/tesseract-hubble-4.jpg" alt="Screenshots of internal tools" />
    <p class="f6 silver i mt1">I defined the product, UX, and an MVP visual design of Tesseract (front, and background). At left, some recent visual design ideas for Hubble from my team.</p>

    <h2 class="mb1 black f2-ns">Internal power</h2>
    <p class="mt0 mb4-ns silver">Compliance and customer insights with Tesseract and Hubble</h2>
    <p class="measure mt0">I enjoy helping my team do their best work, and quality internal tools say a lot about a company&#8217;s culture. Also, when your customers are sitting a few feet away from you, it&#8217;s easy and satisfying to nail product-market fit and deliver great design.</p>
    <p class="measure">Tesseract lets the compliance team examine any detail about any loan we&#8217;ve ever issued. Given that breadth of requirements, it&#8217;s a kind of web interface for SQL selects, optimized for their workflow. </p>
    <p class="measure">Hubble is what the customer insights team uses to view and update account information while talking to the customer on the phone (among many other things). I designed and built much of the first version of this product several years ago, which is still being used today, hundreds of thousands of customers later.</p>

    <p class="measure">This year, Design was asked to create a t-shirt about the core company value &#8220;Ladders not chutes&#8221;. My teammates usually designed the swag, but I decided to take a crack at this one. </p>
    <p class="measure">I wanted to do something hand-drawn, and to entice folks to wear these outside of the gym, I went for something subtler than &#8220;here&#8217;s the startup I work for&#8221;. I painted the original artwork in black, worked with it digitally from there, and oversaw the production.</p>

    <h2 class="mb1 black f2-ns">Set the new standard</h2>
    <p class="mt0 mb4-ns silver">CHARMED is a standard of design quality</p>
    <p class="measure mt0-ns">CHARMED is Coherent, Human, Accessible, Recoverable, Mindful, and Efficient Design. <a href="CHARMED.html" class="link blue">It&#8217;s available here on Github, feel free to try it</a>.</p>
    <p class="measure">This is my evolution of a quality standard called CARMEL that <a href="https://www.lendup.com/blog/design-quality.html" class="link blue">I championed at LendUp</a>. It came about because, while the design team followed many best practices, we weren&#8217;t achieving a user experience of consistently high quality. To solve this, I defined a standard of design quality that is as objective as possible.</p>
