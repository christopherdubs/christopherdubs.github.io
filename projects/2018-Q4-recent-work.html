title: 2018 Q4 Recent Work
description: Create a simple website that represents my recent work, because websites are part of my craft and I enjoy making them.

who: Same folks. They want to easily get a sense of the kind of work I've done recently.

  <p>Nothing exists yet, but here's a brainstorm of projects I might demonstrate</p>
  <ul class="">
    <li>Design quality standard & process (most significant contribution as designer)</li>
    <li>The LendUp Ladder (most significant product design at LendUp)</li>
    <li>Financial health product design concept (very me)</li>
    <li><del class="strike">Loans product page</del> (not that interesting)</li>
    <li>Open loans & Research (core stuff)</li>
    <li><del class="strike">Referral program</del> (I only lightly led this)</li>
    <li>IVR (a non-web UX)</li>
    <li>Internal tools: Tesseract, Hubble</li>
    <li><del class="strike">Make a Payment</del> (not that interesting)</li>
    <li><del class="strike">Rates & Notices</del> (complex but boring)</li>
    <li><del class="strike">Income Verification</del> (complex but too wonky)</li>
    <li><del class="strike">Hackathon projects: Whahappen, Quantum of Utility</del> (good incremental hacks, but no assets available)</li>
    <li>Ladders Not Chutes tee (a cool non-web thing)</li>
    <li>Extracurricular (Posters, album art, furniture, side-project learning apps?)</li>
  </ul>
