    <p class="mt0 measure">Here's how this process has worked specifically for me, in product design, with a small team, diverse stakeholders, complex requirements, and tight timelines. But I find these four steps helpful in solving just about any problem.</p>

  <header class="fn fl-ns w-50-ns pr4-ns">
    <h2 class="mt0 mb0 lh-title">1. Understand</h2>
    <p class="mt2">Get everyone on the same page.</p>
  </header>
  <div class="fn fl-ns w-50-ns">
    <p class="measure mt0">Establish a shared understanding of the problem, the desired outcome, the stakeholders, and the rough plan of action. Define the following:</p>
    <ul class="measure">
      <li>Why we are doing this, how it fits into larger strategy</li>
      <li>Desired business outcomes, e.g. moving metric X by Y%</li>
      <li>Users and their goals</li>
      <li>Stakeholders and their roles (e.g. accountable, responsible, consulted)</li>
      <li>When we want to deliver a solution to customers</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="measure">This step should not take more than one day. The point is to quickly agree to expectations and get to work.</p>

    <h2 class="mt0 mb0 lh-title">2. Diverge</h2>
    <p class="mt2">Dig in, consider possibilities, and structure potential solutions.</p>
  </header>
  <div class="fn fl-ns w-50-ns">
    <p class="measure mt0">This is a meaty and very important step.</p>
    <ul class="measure">
      <li>Do some background research. If there&#8217;s an existing solution, review how it&#8217;s performing, what customers think of it, and our opinions of it. Talk to subject matter experts and explore what competitors do.</li>
      <li>Consider more than one approach to solving the problem. Sketch these out, and make notes about why or why not we might develop them further.</li>
      <li>Model the selected approaches as screens and flows. For each screen, define its responsibilities, their relative importance, the heirarchy, and the potential errors.</li>
      <li>Create lo-fi visual representations of these foundations: wireframes or prototypes. Don&#8217;t get into visual details yet; there&#8217;s a whole next step for that.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="measure">Review with stakeholders, and together, decide which approach(es) to refine. If unsure, bring multiple approaches forward to test.</p>

    <h2 class="mt0 mb0 lh-title">3. Converge</h2>
    <p class="mt2">Define exactly what we intend to deliver.</p>

  <div class="fn fl-ns w-50-ns">
    <p class="measure mt0">OK, <i>now</i> it&#8217;s OK to open Sketch.</p>
    <ul class="measure">
      <li>Create high-fidelity comps or prototypes. Try different visual treatments, as long as they share the foundations established in Diverge. These should feel like natural evolutions, with no big surprises.</li>
      <li>Write all final copy.</li>
      <li>Demonstrate clearly how all contexts and potential errors are handled.</li>
      <li>Prepare any new patterns or components for inclusion in the design system.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="measure">Review with stakeholders, and together, decide what to build. There may be two or more approaches to test.</p>

    <p class="mt2">Build, test, and deliver it to customers.</p>

  <div class="fn fl-ns w-50-ns">
    <p class="measure mt0">Depending on who&#8217;s writing code, either do that or be available to help answer questions and clarify anything that was left ambiguous in the last step. Help ensure it works as intended.</p>
    <p class="measure">Review with stakeholders, and make the decision to ship.</p>

    <p class="measure mt0">This process comes directly from my experience on the design team at LendUp. We worked with the GV design team from time to time, and inspired by their <a href="http://www.gv.com/sprint/">sprint process</a>, we created a version of it for us to use on any project.</p>
