  <div class="fn fl-ns w-50-ns">
    <h3 class="mt0 mb0">C1. Adopt a design system and only use components from the system.</h3>
    <p class="measure mt2">Use a set of standards throughout the product. Consistent look and feel evokes coherence.</p>

    <h3 class="mt4 mb0">C2. The design system itself is CHARMED.</h3>
    <p class="measure mt2">Consider this when adding or updating the system in Converge, or during periodic reviews of the system.</p>

    <h3 class="mt4 mb0">C3. The visual representation of hierarchy and relationships is coherent across screens in a flow.</h3>
    <p class="measure mt2">Screens in a flow share common elements. These elements should be represented in visually coherent ways.</p>

    <h2 class="mt0 mb0 lh-title">Human</h2>

  </header>
  <div class="fn fl-ns w-50-ns">
    <h3 class="mt0 mb0">H1. Language conforms to an adopted style guide.</h3>
    <p class="measure mt2">Use a set of editorial best practices to ensure the product speaks with one voice. Language is useful and usable, embraces principles of clear writing, and adheres to brand attributes.</p>

<article class="cf ph3 ph5-ns pv5 bt">
  <header class="fn fl-ns w-50-ns pr4-ns">
    <h2 class="mt0 mb0 lh-title">Accessible</h2>
    <p class="mt2">It&#8217;s accessible to users of varying abilities on various devices.</p>
  </header>
  <div class="fn fl-ns w-50-ns">
    <h3 class="mt0 mb0">A1. Products follow all criteria of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">WCAG 2.1</a>.</h3>
    <p class="measure mt2">Following these guidelines will make content accessible to a wide range of people with disabilities, including accommodations for blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity, and combinations of these, and some accommodation for learning disabilities and cognitive limitations.</p>

    <h3 class="mt4 mb0">A2. The quality is equal on all supported devices, browsers, and viewports.</h3>
    <p class="measure mt2">Adopt a standard set of devices, browsers, and viewports.</p>

    <h3 class="mt4 mb0">A3. The responsibilities of a screen are not written as affordances.</h3>
    <p>&#8220;Offer a path to sign in&#8221; is a well-phrased responsibility. &#8220;Show a sign in link&#8221; conflates a responsibility with its affordance. Be mindful that laptops, phones, keyboards and assistive devices have different interaction models.</p>

    <h3 class="mt4 mb0">A4. The hierarchy outline of a screen serves as a guide for HTML markup and keyboard navigation.</h3>
    <p class="measure mt2">When developing a hierarchy outline, imagine tabbing through it. This should be how it feels to tab through the interface.</p>

    <h3 class="mt4 mb0">A5. All images have defined alt text.</h3>
    <p class="measure mt2">This will allow the alt text to play the same function on the page as the image. Alt text does not necessarily describe the visual characteristics of the image itself, but must convey the same meaning as the image.</p>

  <header class="fn fl-ns w-50-ns pr4-ns">
    <h2 class="mt0 mb0 lh-title">Recoverable</h2>
    <p class="mt2">Potential errors are prevented up front, and errors are easy to recover from.</p>
  </header>
  <div class="fn fl-ns w-50-ns">
    <h3 class="mt0 mb0">R1. All potential errors are understood.</h3>
    <p class="measure mt2">This sounds obvious, but anytime the user is told something like &#8220;Whoops, an error occurred&#8221;, we obviously don't understand the error.</p>

    <h3 class="mt4 mb0">R2. All potential errors are handled according to their type and preventability.</h3>
    <p class="measure mt2">The type (e.g. invalid input) and preventability (e.g. guidable) of each potential error is understood. According to its type and preventability, handle it appropriately.</p>

<article class="cf ph3 ph5-ns pv5 bt">
  <header class="fn fl-ns w-50-ns pr4-ns">
    <h2 class="mt0 mb0 lh-title">Mindful</h2>
    <p class="mt2">The design thinks so the customer doesn&#8217;t have to.</p>
  </header>
  <div class="fn fl-ns w-50-ns">
    <h3 class="mt0 mb0">M1. There aren&#8217;t too many things on a screen.</h3>
    <p class="measure mt2">Present 5-9 things on any one screen, using chunking and visual hierarchy to distinguish them. If necessary, divide the screen into steps. Otherwise the screen will burden the user&#8217;s short-term memory, and choosing the correct way to continue in the flow will become more time-consuming.</p>

    <h3 class="mt4 mb0">M2. The things on a screen are self-evident, or at least self-explanatory.</h3>
    <p class="measure mt2">A screen that doesn&#8217;t make the user think inspires thoughts like &#8220;OK, there's a ____, and that&#8217;s a ____, and there&#8217;s the thing that I want.&#8221;</p>

    <h3 class="mt4 mb0">M3. The visual design of a screen is grounded in its hierarchy outline.</h3>
    <p class="measure mt2">The hierarchy outline defines the order of elements and how they are logically related. Translating that to visual design:
    Things that are related in the hierarchy outline are related visually. Group them under a heading, display them in the same visual style, and/or put them in an area with a clearly defined boundary. Things are &#8220;nested&#8221; visually to show what&#8217;s part of what.</p>

    <h3 class="mt4 mb0">M4. Use widely-adopted, conventional design patterns.</h3>
    <p class="measure mt2">Users spend most of their time on other sites. Simplify their learning process by providing familiar design patterns.</p>

    <h3 class="mt4 mb0">M5. Visited and unvisited text links are distinguished.</h3>
    <p class="measure mt2">Users don’t have to remember which links they have already visited.</p>

    <h3 class="mt4 mb0">M6. Don&#8217;t float headings between paragraphs.</h3>
    <p class="measure mt2">Headings should be closer to the text that follows them than the text that precedes them.</p>

<article class="cf ph3 ph5-ns pv5 bt">
  <header class="fn fl-ns w-50-ns pr4-ns">
    <h2 class="mt0 mb0 lh-title">Efficient</h2>
    <p class="mt2">It&#8217;s easy to perform a task or find information.</p>
  </header>
  <div class="fn fl-ns w-50-ns">
    <h3 class="mt0 mb0">E1. A flow has as few screens as it needs, but not too few.</h3>
    <p class="mt0 mb0">&#8220;Fewer taps&#8221; always seems like the best approach. But there are valid reasons to use more screens: to simplify choices (E2) by breaking complex tasks into smaller steps, and to ensure (M2) there aren&#8217;t too many things on a screen. More clicks won&#8217;t hurt, as long as each click is a mindless, unambiguous choice.</p>

    <h3 class="mt4 mb0">E2. Choices are easy to make.</h3>
    <p class="measure mt2">The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices: which link to click, which text to read, which radio button to select, how to enter something into a text field. Limit the amount of decisions a user has to make to achieve their goal, and highlight recommended options.</p>

    <h3 class="mt4 mb0">E3. The more important something is, the more prominent it is.</h3>
    <p class="measure mt2">To ensure the user notices something, make it impossible to miss. Important things are larger, bolder, in a distinctive color, set off by more whitespace, nearer the top of the screen, or some combination of these.</p>

    <h3 class="mt4 mb0">E4. Things intended to be easily selectable are large and easily within reach.</h3>
    <p class="measure mt2">The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target. This especially applies to buttons, which should be easy to find and select.</p>

    <h3 class="mt4 mb0">E5. What&#8217;s clickable is obvious. And if something looks clickable, it&#8217;s clickable.</h3>
    <p class="measure mt2">As a user, I should never have to devote a millisecond to whether things are clickable or not.</p>
